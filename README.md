## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

``` bash
# To run minified version quickly in linux/mac systems
cd dist && python -m SimpleHTTPServer
visit http://localhost:8000
```
Thank you for this oppotunity!
